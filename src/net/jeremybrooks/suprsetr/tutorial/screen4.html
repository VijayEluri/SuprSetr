        <h1>Preferences</h1>
        <p>You can access the Preferences dialog box from the Edit menu
            (Windows and Linux), or from the SuprSetr application menu (Mac).
            You can control the behavior of tweets
            (automatically adding via SuprSetr if there is room), add "Managed by SuprSetr" to
            the end of set descriptions for managed sets, allow SuprSetr to check for
            updates at startup, control how long it should be before a set needs
            to be refreshed, and how many faves are needed for a fave tag to be
            added by FavrTagr.</p>

        <p> There are also tabs allowing you to deauthorize/reauthorize Flickr,
            authorize/deauthorize Twitter, and set up network proxy
            information.</p>
