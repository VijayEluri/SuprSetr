        <h1>The Main Window</h1>
        <p>The SuprSetr main window displays a list of your photosets. Sets that
            SuprSetr manages will be listed first, followed by sets that are not
            managed in alphabetic order. You can choose to hide the unmanaged
            sets by using the options in the View menu.</p>

        <p>At the top of the main window you will find the toolbar. The toolbar
            contains buttons to add, edit, delete, and refresh your sets. These
            options correspond to the options found in the Edit menu. In
            addition, there is a filter text box. If you enter text into the
            filter box, only sets that contain text in the title which matches
            the filter text will be displayed.</p>

        <p>To view a set on Flickr, you can right-click a set and select Open
            Set in Browser, or use the option in the File menu.</p>
