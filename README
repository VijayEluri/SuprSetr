SuprSetr - advanced set management for Flickr

***** This is beta software. It certainly has bugs. If it eats your cat, burns your
house down, and makes your mother-in-law move in, don't blame me. I warned you. *****

That said, SuprSetr should be quite safe to use. It CAN delete sets from Flickr
if you ask it to, but it cannot delete photos. Sets can always be created again.

When you start SuprSetr, it will connect to Flickr and get a list of all your
sets. Data about these sets will be stored in a local database, and updated
every time you launch SuprSetr. This process takes a little while the first
time SuprSetr is launched. Subsequent launches will be faster.

The first time you launch SuprSetr, none of the sets are managed. You can add a
new set by selecting Edit -> Create Set from the menu, or edit an existing set
by double clicking it in the list or selecting Edit -> Edit Set from the menu.
After saving the changes, the set will be refreshed on Flickr, and the list will
 be updated as well.

Sets can also be deleted by selecting Edit -> Delete Set from the menu. Deleting
a set will remove it permanently from Flickr, but will not delete the photos
that it contains.

To refresh a set, select Edit -> Refresh Set from the menu. Currently, a set
can be refreshed at any time. Sets are displayed in the list sorted by
managed/unmanaged, then alphabetically. Managed sets will always display at the
top of the list. Additional sort options may be added in the future if users
want that feature.

Performance issues when updating the list model


*** DEVELOPERS ***
This is a NetBeans project. The files you need should be in the git repository.
If you are going to make changes to the forms, please use the NetBeans form
builder tool to do it so that the source code it generates will not get messed
up. Thanks!
