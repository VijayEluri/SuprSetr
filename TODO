get rid of whirljackcommon as a dependency

When the list is filtered, and a new set is added that matches the filter,
it is not visible.

When list shows only managed sets, and you uncheck "manage this set" and save the
change without refreshing, the set should be removed from the list model.




BUG: when adding a new set, if the list is filtered to show less photos than the
     position of the new set, an error occurs:
ERROR net.jeremybrooks.suprsetr.workers.AddPhotosetWorker [AWT-EventQueue-0] 2010-04-18 08:31:43,773 - ERROR WHILE TRYING TO UPDATE LIST MODEL.

 * Support multiple accounts




MIGHT BE FIXED: TEST THESE
==========================
BUG: If you select “Hide unmanaged sets” when you’ve got no managed sets the
screen is blank, which is correct.However, if you then close down and reopen
SuprSetr this error message is displayed:
"Error trying to update the list" (Andrew Lighten)
