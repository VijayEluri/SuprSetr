Make the Tweet text box in Set Editor wrap words.

When the list is filtered, and a new set is added that matches the filter,
it is not visible.

Import from smartsetr (troy)
Add a "Manage all sets" checkbox to facilitate migration to SuprSetr (troy) -- won't fix

use BrowserLauncher from whirljack common.
    (Depends on moving BrowserLauncher to whirljack common)

When list shows only managed sets, and you uncheck "manage this set" and save the
change without refreshing, the set should be removed from the list model.




BUG: when adding a new set, if the list is filtered to show less photos than the
     position of the new set, an error occurrs:
ERROR net.jeremybrooks.suprsetr.workers.AddPhotosetWorker [AWT-EventQueue-0] 2010-04-18 08:31:43,773 - ERROR WHILE TRYING TO UPDATE LIST MODEL.

 * Set search level to RESTRICTED (bug in Flickr API is preventing this, but is supported in 0.9.4)
   via a hidden option in the Advanced pane of the Set Editor


Post 1.0

 * Add sorting options for list view
 * Timed refresh; or run in background with command line options.
 * Flickr Collection support (missing from the API. bummer.)
 * ENH: Handle different date formats, or provide a pop up calendar to select dates (Andrew Lighten)
 * Support multiple accounts




MIGHT BE FIXED: TEST THESE
==========================
BUG: If you select “Hide unmanaged sets” when you’ve got no managed sets the
screen is blank, which is correct.However, if you then close down and reopen
SuprSetr this error message is displayed:
"Error trying to update the list" (Andrew Lighten)
